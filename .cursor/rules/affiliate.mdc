Owners can customize important parameters such as the minimum balance to request a withdrawal and the minimum/maximum withdrawal amount. Customizing limits allows owners to adjust the withdrawal process and ensure compliance with financial policies, maintain stability and manage the affiliate program effectively.

- Automatic email to admin in time: Immediately notify the administrator whenever a withdrawal request and registration are made. This feature not only helps the store owner to know about new members immediately but also provides a means to effectively manage the related payment fees.
